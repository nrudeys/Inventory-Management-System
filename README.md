## Description
The Inventory Management System implemented using Java Swing, JDBC API, and SQLite.
The goal of this application is for users to track and modify inventory items and sales.

## Getting Started
### Technologies
* Java 1.7
* Java Swing
* JDBC API
* SQLite 
* Maven
* JFreeChart
* IDE: NetBeans

### How to Run
In the terminal, paste: git clone https://github.com/nrudeys/Inventory-Management-System.git or 
download the repository as a zip file, extract, and locate/open IMSys.exe. 
<br> NOTE: Do not remove the IMSys.exe from the folder as it is dependent on IMS.db 

## Usage
### Tables
In the inventory and sales tables, users can SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE an entry. 
These features are access through the Add and Edit buttons located in the upper right of the application. 
Additionally, both tables can be sorted by columns either in ascending or descending order. 
This is done by clicking on the column name of either table. <br>
<br> 
Note: the inventory table profit and ROI column values are generated when inventory items are added into the sales 
table.<br>
